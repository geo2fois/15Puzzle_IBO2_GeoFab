The 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle
that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.
The puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle,
and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle.
The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order (see diagram) by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

The n-puzzle is a classical problem for modelling algorithms involving heuristics.
Commonly used heuristics for this problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the taxicab distances
between each block and its position in the goal configuration.
Note that both are admissible, i.e. they never overestimate the number of moves left, which ensures optimality for certain search algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's.
